The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with added blockchain security and immutability through Solidity. It ensures data protection with encryption. The system uses Ganache as a local blockchain network and Metamask as a secure HD wallet, ensuring safe data storage and transactions.

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

Install Node.js and Ganache on your system.
Set up a dedicated workspace and add the Metamask extension to your browser. Connect your Metamask account with the Ganache account.
Clone the repository and install the dependencies using the command #npm install#.
Once the dependencies are installed, deploy the smart contracts to your blockchain with the command #npm truffle deploy# to compile and deploy the contracts.
Finally, use #npm run start# to launch the application.
